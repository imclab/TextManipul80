# TextManipul80
A simple OSX app for manipulating text.

Splits text into an array of values using "Value delimiter" to separate, adds "Value prefix" and "Value postfix" to each value and then spits out the resulting text.

For those that want to save the brain cycles required to decypher regex for the 1000th time. ;P
